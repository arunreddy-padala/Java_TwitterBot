# TwitterBot_Java

This project demonstrates the development of an automated Twitter bot using Java, integrated with the Twitter API through Twitter4J. The bot is designed to read tweets from a text file and post them on Twitter at specified intervals, utilizing Maven for managing dependencies and multithreading to handle API rate limits efficiently.

Languages & Frameworks: Java, Twitter API, Twitter4J, Maven

Features:
- Automated Tweeting: Automatically sends out tweets read from a .txt file, allowing for scheduled posts without manual intervention.
- Dependency Management: Utilizes Maven to handle external libraries, specifically Twitter4J, which simplifies the integration with the Twitter API.
- File Handling: Reads tweets line by line from a designated text file, ensuring each tweet is posted in sequence.
- Rate Limit Management: Implements multithreading to pause the botâ€™s operation between tweets, effectively managing the Twitter API rate limits and avoiding potential timeouts or bans.
